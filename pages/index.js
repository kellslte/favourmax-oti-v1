            I have a background in backend development and a knack for
            problem-solving, which makes me the perfect candidate for your next
            project. If you need someone to come in and build something
            completely new from the ground up, or if you'd just like some help
            refining an idea that's already been in your head for a while but
            hasn't quite come together (yet), I'm here for you. I can also help
            with any of your other needsâ€”like finding dead ends in any project
            and figuring out what it will take to fix them. And if you need
            someone who knows how to make things happen, then I'm your guy! My
            experience has taught me that no problem is too big or too small
            when it comes to making sure we get what we want accomplished. I
            currently work at {" "}
